# ü©ª COVID-19 Detection from Chest X-rays using CNN & Grad-CAM

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect **COVID-19, Normal, Lung Opacity, and Viral Pneumonia** from chest X-ray images. It also provides a **Grad-CAM heatmap** visualization to highlight regions in the X-ray image that contributed most to the prediction.

## üìå Features

- **COVID-19 Detection**: Detects if a chest X-ray is COVID-19 positive or falls under other classes like Normal, Lung Opacity, or Viral Pneumonia.
- **Grad-CAM Heatmap**: Highlights important regions in the X-ray influencing the model's decision.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Built using [Gradio](https://gradio.app) for easy image upload or webcam capture.
- **Download Results**: Save the heatmap overlay for offline use.
